| `git status -s`                   | Shows the status in a short, condensed format, making it easier to quickly see changes.                                                                                          |
| `git add <file_name>`             | Adds a specific file to the staging area, preparing it for a commit. Example: `git add example.txt`.                                                                             |
| `git add --all`                   | Adds all new and changed files to the staging area. This includes all files in the entire repository.                                                                            |
| `git add -A`                      | Similar to `git add --all`, adds all changes from the entire working tree to the staging area.                                                                                   |
| `git add .`                       | Adds new and modified files in the current directory to the staging area. This does not add removed files.                                                                       |
| `git commit -m "message"`         | Records changes to the repository with a descriptive message. Example: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.                                                                         |
| `git commit -a -m "message"`      | Combines adding changes and committing them in one step for modified and deleted files (but not new files). Example: `git commit -a -m "Updated configs"`.                       |
| `git commit --amend`              | Opens the default configured text editor for modifying the most recent commit.                                                                                                   |
| `git commit --amend -m "message"` | Modifies the most recent commit. This can be used to correct typos in the previous commit's message.                                                                             |

## Undoing Changes and Comparing Differences üîÑ

Managing changes effectively is a crucial aspect of version control with Git. This section provides detailed commands for undoing changes and comparing different states of your repository. Whether you need to revert changes, compare updates, or simply review historical modifications, the following commands will guide you through managing your project's evolution safely and efficiently.

### File Operations in Git üóÇÔ∏è

Managing files efficiently within a Git repository is crucial for maintaining an organized and clean working environment. This section covers essential commands for renaming and deleting files, as well as removing untracked files to ensure your repository stays tidy.

#### Rename and Delete Files üîÄüóëÔ∏è

Renaming or deleting files in Git can be done using simple commands that also stage these changes for commit, making these operations seamless and efficient.

| Command                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git mv <old_file> <new_file>`                      | Renames a file and stages the change. This is the simplest way to rename a file in Git.                                                                        |
| `git rm <file>`                                     | Deletes a file and stages the deletion. This is straightforward for removing files from tracking.                                                              |
| `git mv <old_file> <new_file> && git rm <old_file>` | Renames a file and then deletes the old one in two steps if needed for more control over the operations.                                                       |

#### Cleaning Untracked Files üßπ

Sometimes your working directory can get cluttered with build outputs, log files, or other untracked files. Git provides a powerful command to clean your working directory to revert it back to a clean state.

| Command                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git clean`     | Remove untracked files from the working directory. By default, it does not remove directories.                                                                                                     |
| `git clean -fd` | Removes all untracked files and directories. The `-f` is for force, and `-d` tells Git to remove directories as well.                                                                              |

### Undoing Changes üîô

Sometimes you need to undo changes or clean up your working directory. Whether you accidentally staged files, committed wrong changes, or simply need to revert to a previous state, Git provides powerful tools to revert these actions without losing data.

|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git restore <file_name>`                 | Restores a file from the staging area back to the working directory. Example: `git restore example.txt`.                                                                 |
| `git restore ./`                          | Restores all files in the current directory from the staging area back to the working directory.                                                                         |
| `git restore --staged <file_name>`        | Unstages a file while keeping the changes in the working directory. Example: `git restore --staged example.txt`.                                                         |
| `git restore --staged ./`                 | Unstages all changes in the current directory while keeping changes in the working directory.                                                                            |
| `git restore --source=HEAD~1 <file_name>` | Restores a file to a previous version from one commit ago. Example: `git restore --source=HEAD~1 example.txt`.                                                           |
| `git restore --staged --worktree <file>` or `./`               | Unstages changes to a file and restores the file to the state it has in the current commit, keeping the changes in the working directory.           |
| `git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree <file>` or `./` | Resets a file to the state it has in the latest commit (`HEAD`), both in the staging area and the working directory.                                |

### Reverting Changes üîÑ

The `git revert` command creates a new commit that undoes changes introduced by a previous commit. It is useful for safely undoing changes without altering the commit history.

| **Command**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             |

Dive deeper into the structure of your Git repository with these commands, which allow you to list tracked files, explore tree objects, and examine the details of specific commits or blobs. Understanding these elements will enable you to manage and diagnose your repository‚Äôs content more effectively.

| Command                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git ls-files`                | Lists all the files currently being tracked by Git in the repository. This command helps you see which files are included in the version control system.                             |
| `git ls-tree <commit>`        | Lists the contents of a tree object corresponding to a commit. This shows directories and files in a commit, helping to visualize the structure at that point in history.            |
| `git cat-file -t <sha_value>` | Displays the type of the object stored in Git's database with the specified SHA. Example: `git cat-file -t 3a0b9ec` might output `commit`, `blob`, or `tree`, depending on the type. |
| `git cat-file -p <sha_value>` | Prints the content of the object specified by its SHA. Example: `git cat-file -p 3a0b9ec` could show the contents of a commit, a file (blob), or a directory structure (tree).       |

## GitIgnore File üö´

The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. A typical .gitignore file will contain patterns that match file names or directories, and it can include standard glob patterns which allow for flexible matching. For example:

1. Ignore all .log files: *.log
2. Ignore a specific directory: node_modules/

## Resetting Changes üîÑ

Whether you need to undo changes or completely revert your repository to a previous state, the git reset command offers powerful options. From soft resets that preserve changes in your working directory to hard resets that clean your working tree, mastering these commands is crucial for correcting mistakes and maintaining a clean project history.

| Command                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git reset`                        | Resets the staging area to match the latest commit but does not affect the working directory or current branch, effectively unstaging all staged changes.                       |
| `git reset --hard`                 | Resets the staging area and the working directory to match the current HEAD. This command discards all changes in both the staging area and the working directory.              |
| `git reset --soft`                 | Resets only the HEAD to the current commit without touching the staging area or the working directory.                                                                          |
| `git reset --mixed`                | Resets the staging area to match the HEAD but does not affect the working directory. This is the default mode for git reset.                                                    |
| `git reset --keep`                 | Resets the current HEAD to the specified commit, but unlike `--hard`, it keeps your local changes as long as they do not conflict with the files that are reset.                |
| `git reset <sha_value>`            | Moves the current branch's tip backward to the specified commit (`<sha_value>`), unstaging changes that occurred after that commit but keeping them in the working directory. Here we can add flags as well. Such as `--soft` to move the HEAD but not touch staging and working directory. `--mixed` to unstage the changes and moving them to working tree. `--hard` to move the HEAD and discard all changes. `--keep` to move the HEAD but keep the changes.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `git reset HEAD~<number>`          | Resets the repository to `<number>` commits before the current HEAD. This number can be any positive integer. The same way we can use `--soft` to move the HEAD but not touch staging and working directory. `--mixed` to unstage the changes and moving them to working directory. `--hard` to move the HEAD and discard all changes. `--keep` to move the HEAD but keep the changes.               |

### Add Origin ‚ûï

Adding an 'origin' is crucial for defining the primary remote source of your repository. This typically points to the repository from which you directly push and pull changes. Additionally, setting up an 'upstream' is fundamental for working with forks, allowing you to stay updated with the original repository.
